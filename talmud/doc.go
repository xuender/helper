// Package talmud implements the Talmudic principles for fair debt allocation.
// This package provides algorithms for distributing payments among multiple debts
// according to the rules derived from the Talmud, specifically the method known
// as the "Talmudic division" or "Ketubah problem" solution.
//
// The main algorithm uses a recursive approach to ensure fair distribution of
// limited funds among creditors when the total debt exceeds available assets.
